 <p align="justify">
This paper examines the impact of financial incentive policies on regional shortages of general practitioners (GPs) in England. The study focuses on the Targeted Enhanced Recruitment Scheme (TERS), which provides a one-time payment of £20,000 to GP specialty trainees in specific areas. The results demonstrate that the TERS policy increases the number of trainees by 38% per patient. However, this increase is accompanied by the reduction in the number of senior GPs. Additionally, the study estimates a demand and supply model for general practices and evaluates the effects of an alternative policy proposal: reallocating NHS funding from the least to the most deprived practices and fund increasing to most deprived practices. The findings indicate that reallocating 10% of funds leads to a 1.5% increase and fund increasing by 10% leads to 1% increase in the number of GPs per 10,000 patients. This suggests a small elasticity of labor supply in response to funding changes in general practices. </p>

## The Effect of Workload on Primary Care doctors on Referral Rates and Prescription Patterns: Evidence from English NHS, (with <a href="https://www.health.org.uk/about-the-health-foundation/our-people/REAL-centre-team/toby-watt" target="_blank">Toby Watt</a>).

This paper investigates the impact of workload pressure on primary care outcomes using a unique dataset from English general practices. Leveraging the absence of GP colleagues as an instrumental variable, we find that increased workload leads to a reduction in routine referral rates while prescription rates increase. Urgent referrals and assessment appointments rise with heightened workload. Workload intensification is driven by GP partners, and the mode of consultation shifts toward remote interactions. The effects are more pronounced for patients under 65 and those in most deprived areas. Small practices exhibit higher sensitivity to workload fluctuations. Our study sheds light on the intricate relationship between workload pressure and patient care decisions in primary care settings.
