## Primary Care Doctors’ Shortages and the Role of Financial Incentives
 <p align="justify">
This paper examines the impact of financial incentive policies on regional shortages of general practitioners (GPs) in England. Using a difference-in-differences analysis, the study focuses on the Targeted Enhanced Recruitment Scheme (TERS), which provides a one-time payment of £20,000 to GP specialty trainees in specific areas. The results demonstrate that the TERS policy increases the number of trainees by 34% per patient. However, this increase is accompanied by the departure of senior GPs from the profession. Additionally, the study estimates a demand and supply model for general practices and evaluates the effects of an alternative policy proposal: reallocating NHS funding from the least to the most deprived practices. The findings indicate that reallocating 10% of funds leads to a 1% increase in the number of GPs. This suggests a small elasticity of labor supply in response to funding changes in general practices. </p>

## The Effect of Workload on Primary Care doctors on Referral Rates and Prescription Patterns: Evidence from English NHS
<p align="justify">
description: In this paper, we investigate the consequences of greater workload on primary care provision in England. GPs had an average of 0.28 additional appointments per absent colleague per day in 2016-2019. We employ instrumental variable to causally identify the effect of workload pressure on doctors on patient outcomes. We find that greater workload leads to fewer referrals being made. A 10% increase in GP workload reduces the probability of referral by 0.06 percentage points, which is equivalent to a 3% reduction. We also find that the effect is exacerbated for patients living in deprived areas, patients with more underlying health conditions and for smaller GP practices with fewer assistant and nursing staff. We show that the probability of giving any prescription is reduced by greater workload on average. However, conditional on a prescription occurring, GPs are likely to prescribe a shorter course of antibiotics, while the quantity of opioid drugs per prescription is larger when workload is greater.
