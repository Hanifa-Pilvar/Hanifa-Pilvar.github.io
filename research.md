    description:  We evaluate the effect of a major health care policy in public hospitals which changed the demand and supply side incentives for c-section procedures in 2014 in Iran, where the c-section rate at the time was 55\%. Following the reform, vaginal delivery became free for patients. The policy also introduced financial incentives to doctors for performing vaginal deliveries and set a cap on their maximum c-section rate. We show that supply side incentives had a major role in the effectiveness of the programme, after which the national rate reduced by 6 percentage points. This reduction was mainly driven by first-birth mothers. The reform also shifted doctors with high c-section rates out of public hospitals . We cannot find any adverse effect on Apgar score, hospitalisation or mortality; however, gestation length and birth weight significantly increased.

    description: In this paper, we investigate the consequences of greater workload on primary care provision in England. GPs had an average of 0.28 additional appointments per absent colleague per day in 2016-2019. We employ instrumental variable to causally identify the effect of workload pressure on doctors on patient outcomes. We find that greater workload leads to fewer referrals being made. A 10\% increase in GP workload reduces the probability of referral by 0.06 percentage points, which is equivalent to a 3\% reduction. We also find that the effect is exacerbated for patients living in deprived areas, patients with more underlying health conditions and for smaller GP practices with fewer assistant and nursing staff. We show that the probability of giving any prescription is reduced by greater workload on average. However, conditional on a prescription occurring, GPs are likely to prescribe a shorter course of antibiotics, while the quantity of opioid drugs per prescription is larger when workload is greater.
