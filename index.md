I am Hanifa Pilvar, a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Economics and Finance, Queen Mary University of London. My primary research focuses on empirical microeconomics and health economics. Specifically, my work centers around understanding physician behavior and incentives, as well as the implications of physician shortages and potential strategies for mitigation. Additionally, I am actively engaged as a collaborator at The Health Foundation and serve as a research fellow at UCL. At UCL, I contribute to <a href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/researchActivity/37000">Mental Health Admissions to Paediatric Wards Study (MAPS)</a>.
